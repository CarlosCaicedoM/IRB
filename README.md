# Biochemical Reactions Engineering
In this project we try to keep an updated repository of the codes that we use in the course Biochemical Reaction Engineering at the University of Antioquia.

To use this project, simply navigate through each file where you can find the code to solve a problem that is part of the content of the course. 

This is designed to be used by undergraduate students interested in bioreactor design using some tools and libraries available in Python. 

The project cover the following topics:

- Introduction to Python
- Chemical reactions: Isothermal Reactor Design 
- Biochemical reactor design

  - Unstructured models
  - Structured models

- Analysis of data an kinetics parameters fitting
- Enzymatic kinetics
- Heterogeneous reactions
